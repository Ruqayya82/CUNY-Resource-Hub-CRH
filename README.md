🏛️ CUNY Resource Hub (CRH)
All CUNY Resources, One Click Away.

🌟 Overview

The CUNY Resource Hub (CRH) is a unified web platform designed to make it easier for CUNY students to find and access support services across all campuses.
Instead of browsing multiple college websites, students can use CRH to search, filter, and explore verified campus resources—all in one place.

This project was developed for the CISC 4900 course at Brooklyn College and CUNY Tech Prep, with the goal of demonstrating how technology can simplify student support access across a large educational system.

🎯 Mission

To streamline access to essential student support services and reduce information barriers within the CUNY system by providing a single, searchable, and user-friendly hub.

👁️ Vision

A future where every CUNY student, regardless of their campus, can instantly find the help they need — whether it's academic, financial, emotional, or professional, it's all in a centralized digital platform.

👥 End Users

CUNY Students: Primary users seeking access to academic, financial, wellness, and student support services.

Advisors & Administrators: Secondary users who can recommend resources and use CRH as a verified directory.

🧩 Problem Space

CUNY’s 26 campuses each maintain their own support sites, making it difficult and time-consuming for students to find accurate, relevant resources.
CRH solves this by consolidating these services into a centralized, searchable database.
